# vw-ContextualBandits - Python / Data Science Exercise
For this exercise weâ€™ll look into how non-stationarity affects different Contextual Bandit algorithms.

First, get yourself familiarized with the Simulating Content Personalization with Contextual Bandits Vowpal Wabbit tutorial and in particular the second scenario, which shows the effects of non-stationarity.

Task
Modify the second scenario in the following ways:
- Add multiple changes to the reward distribution over time
- Introduce varying noise in the reward distribution

Run this new simulator with different exploration algorithms and vizualize and compare their performance.

The Jupyter notebook showcasing the above can be found [**here**](https://github.com/JuiP/vw-ContextualBandits/blob/main/Contextual_Bandits.ipynb).
